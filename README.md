# Shrek Matching

## Description

Shrek Matching is a super fun website where you can compete in a head to head matching game with Shrek images! It has things like Shrek, waffles, Gingy, and more! Whoever has the highest score (amount of matches) when every cards' match is found, wins!

## Technologies

The frontend is build with React and TypeScript, with the backend using Express, Type Script, and Prisma/PostgreSQL for the database. During gameplay, I am using Socket.IO for real-time communication to live update the card changes.

## Game Instructions

1. Create an account and login
2. Join or create a match
3. Wait for other players and click start!
4. When you name is underlined, it's your turn to flip two cards
5. If the cards match, you get a point and wait for everyone else to take their turns
6. Once all cards are matched, you find out if you won or lost!
